Hello there, welcome to the shiny new RIG-NITC blog!

A cornucopia for all robotics enthusiasts and tech-savvy people out there from a group of people whose mind rejoices with perpetual passion for Robotics and more.

This blog was started as a forum to release not only robotics-related informational content, but even general tech relevant posts. This serves as a platform to primarily help people through their dilemmas, problems faced in these two domains that we too have faced and have had the fortunate guidance to get through.

## Who we are and a brief history

The team at Robotics Interest Group aka RIG are undergraduate students spanning all disciplines such as Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science from sophomores to final-year students. We are involved in an array of projects, which will be shortly detailed, and a lot of competitions as well! 

Let's go all the way back to 2011, when the seeds for the community were sown.

In 2011, a group of students became enthused about participating in the prestigious international robotics event, RoboCon 2012. Despite their dedicated efforts during the holidays to construct robots, they encountered a financial obstacle. Seeking assistance from the institute, they were informed that they had yet to establish their credibility. Undeterred, two students decided to broaden their scope and explore additional opportunities in robotics.

Consequently, a cohesive group of 14 students formed, seeking guidance from Mr. Sudheer A.P., a distinguished figure in the field of robotics in the college. Overcoming challenges, they proudly unveiled their first creation – the Plotterbot v1.0. This helped them to establish their credibility in the institution. Their journey continued with the restoration of a lab machine, extended lab access, and successful modeling endeavors. During their academic breaks, they dedicated their time on campus to working on projects. As a result of their efforts, a significant presentation on May 20th became a turning point. This led to the official recognition of the Robotics Interest Group (RIG) and consequently, securing the necessary funding for the upcoming RoboCon 2013.

In a dedicated effort to share their knowledge, the Robotics Interest Group (RIG) organized a comprehensive workshop at NIT Calicut, focusing on the fundamental principles of robotics. The event aimed to impart essential insights and skills in the realm of robotics to the students of NIT Calicut. The workshop garnered substantial attention, attracting an impressive turnout of over a number of enthusiastic participants. The positive response and acclaim received for the event reflected the effectiveness of RIG's instructional approach. Their narrative underscores the transformative impact of passion, dedication, and a shared vision. It serves as an inspiration for all to persevere, explore every opportunity diligently, and invest unwavering effort, knowing that enduring commitment ultimately leads to success.

## Our Achievements

Here are some of our achievements and testimonies from the participants from RIG:

### Robocon 2023

### MATLAB Minidrone Challenge 2024

### Janatics Automation Challenge 2024

### LAM Research Challenge 2024

The LAM Research Challenge 2024 was a competition designed for students to showcase their systems engineering skills by implementing a cross-disciplinary approach including firmware, hardware, systems thinking and keen business operations acumen while arriving at solutions.
And of course, a dedicated team from RIG decided to show their mettle too!

Here is a brief recounting of the event from one of the seniormost members of RIG, Karthik Manoranjan:

> On November 28th and 29th, we, a team of four—Karthik Manoranjan, Jerin Shaji, Jomal Joy, and Nithin Yadav—participated in the finals of the Lam Research Challenge, securing a spot among the top 25 teams in India.
>
> We built a 4 DOF manipulator arm entirely from scratch using the provided components. The task was to reshuffle a set of colored disks placed on two towers automatically, with the reshuffling order determined by input from a custom GUI. The mechanical assembly involved precise linkages and joints for optimal movement and range. Servo and stepper motors ensured smooth and accurate positioning, while the control system, programmed in ROS2, enabled seamless operation. A Y-shaped gripper handled the disks efficiently, for stable handling and placement.
>
> Competing on such a prestigious platform alongside some of the brightest minds in the country was both inspiring and humbling. This experience has fueled our passion for robotics and motivated us to aim for even greater milestones in the future.

## The Way Forward

As we reflect on our history, Robotics Interest Group (RIG) stands as a testament to the resilience, creativity, and unbreakable spirit of its members. Beyond the challenges of RoboCon 2012, we have evolved into a community that not only crafts robots but also seeks to share knowledge and ignite the minds of the next generation. Today, we carry the legacy of overcoming obstacles and transforming adversity into triumph. Our commitment extends beyond competitions; we aim to inspire and educate, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of robotics. Continuing our journey, we still conduct workshops, share knowledge, and strive to make a meaningful impact on the evolving landscape of robotics, fostering innovation and contributing to the transformative advancements shaping our future.
