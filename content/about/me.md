title: About US

The Robotics Interest Group (RIG) was established out of a strong enthusiasm for robotics, aiming to support education and research in areas such as Mechatronics, Robotics, Intelligent Systems, Automation, Advanced Control Systems, Modeling and Simulation, as well as Sensors and Algorithms. Our goal is to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience to keep pace with the evolving technologies. We also seek to collaborate with industries to drive innovation, create commercially viable products, and contribute to our country's development. In addition to technological progress, we prioritize engaging in socially relevant projects that benefit the general public. To ensure the knowledge is passed on, we organize workshops, exhibitions, and lectures for students, encouraging them to explore and develop an interest in these fields.
